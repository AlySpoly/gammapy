TeV high-level data analysis method demo.

Notes:
* Don't use this package!
* It's just a prototype implementation of TeV data analysis methods,
meant to serve as a reference for discussions / definitions / test cases
of a proper implementation in `gammalib`_ in this coding `sprint`_.
* I just took the `Astropy`_ package template to have the infrastructure for
build, intall, test, docs, ... I don't plan to make this an astropy affiliated package.
