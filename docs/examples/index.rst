Examples
========

The ``gammapy/examples`` folder contains small Python scripts
illustrating how to use Gammapy.

.. note:: For now the full list of examples is only available here:
   https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/tree/master/examples
   
   We plan to integrate that into the online Sphinx docs ...
   please help if you know how to do this:
   https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/issues/172
