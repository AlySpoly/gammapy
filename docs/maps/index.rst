Data Structures for Images and Cubes (`gammapy.maps`)

.. currentmodule:: gammapy.maps

Introduction
============

`gammapy.maps` contains classes for representing data structures which
have at least 2 dimensions representing coordinates on a sphere.
These classes support an arbitrary number of non-spatial dimensions
and can represent images (2D), cubes (3D), or hypercubes (4D).  Two
pixelization schemes are supported:
* WCS
* HEALPix
