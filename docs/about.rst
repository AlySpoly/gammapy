Support Gammapy
---------------

If you use Gammapy in your work, we would be grateful if you could include an acknowledgment in papers and/or presentations.

Currently there is no academic reference for Gammapy.
We have submitted a poster for `ICRC 2015 <http://icrc2015.nl/>`__
and plan to write a paper about it after the Gammapy 1.0 release in fall 2015.

For now, you could mention the URL https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy or include the Gammapy banner.
