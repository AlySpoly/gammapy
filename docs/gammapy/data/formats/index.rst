Introduction
============

Here we describe various data file formats that are useful for the exchange
of TeV data, instrument response functions and results.

Where available and useful existing standards (TODO: links) are used, e.g.
for spectral data the X-ray community has developed the PHA, ARF and RMF
file formats and they have developed powerful tools to work with data in that format.

In other cases (flux points, point spread function, run lists) there is no standard and
we simply invent 

TODO: for every data format there should be an example in the datasets.
