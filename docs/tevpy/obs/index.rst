Observation bookkeeping  (`tevpy.obs`)

Introduction
============

`tevpy.obs` contains methods to do the bookkeeping for processing multiple observations.

In TeV astronomy an observation (a.k.a. a run) means pointing the telescopes at some
position on the sky (fixed in celestial coordinates, not in horizon coordinates)
for a given amount of time (e.g. half an hour) and switching the central trigger on.

The total dataset for a given target will usually consist of a few to a few 100 runs
and some book-keeping is required when running the analysis.
