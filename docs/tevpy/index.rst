=======

What is it?
-----------

`tevpy` is an open source (BSD licensed) TeV gamma-ray astronomy high-level data analysis Python package.

* Code: https://github.com/gammapy/tevpy
* Docs: https://tevpy.readthedocs.org/

.. warning:: `tevpy` is at a very early stage of development and it's main purpose is to quickly prototype
   the implementation of analysis methods for a proper implementation in `GammaLib`_ and `ctools`_.
   `tevpy` also serves as an interface to other existing astro (or more generally scientific) Python packages.
